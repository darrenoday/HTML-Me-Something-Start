         <header id="mainHeading">My LaunchCode Story So Far</header>
            <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">This is an account of my experiences and the lessons I've learned since I enrolled in the LaunchCode
               course in January of 2024</p>
           
               <div> <h>The Beginning</h>
            <p>Before this class, I had never done any coding of any kind. I was incredibly nervous about the whole idea
               of taking a course with my limited knowledge in the subject. I assumed i wouldn't be selected since I
               heard the course only took a limited number of applicants
            </p>

            <div><h>Getting into it</h>
            <p> A few weeks into the course my head was buzzing with different coding concepts. I found that I was
               capable of learning the material and felt a swell of pride any time I typed "node index" into my terminal
               and saw the console output the desired result. I also had become fascinated by the lore contained in the
               textbook for the course. It seemed I would be learning how to send animals into space in addition to
               javascript.</p>

            <div><h>Skills</h>
            <p>Over the last 2 months I've learned a lot. I can work with strings, arrays and objects, using various
               methods to manipulate them. I can create functions and define classes of objects as well. I know how to
               use conditional logic and write tests using jest for unit testing. I've written a lot of different
               programs as exercises for these concepts, including the <s>dreaded</s> super fun mars rover assignment </p>
